        <h3>General Notes</h3>
            <p>When meeting with any health professional, it is important for you to share the following information:
            <br>
            <br>
             &#8226; Your medical history and allergies (medication, food, or other);
            <br>
            <br>
             &#8226; If you smoke, are pregnant, are planning a pregnancy, or are breastfeeding;
            <br>
            <br>
            &#8226; The names of all the medications you take, whether you take them regularly or once in a while, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and natural health products.<br>
            <br>
            It is also strongly recommended that you keep an up-to-date list of all the medications you take and carry it with you at all times. This could be useful if you have to see a health professional or need emergency care.
